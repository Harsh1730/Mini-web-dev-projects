    <h2>1. Encapsulation</h2>
    <p>Encapsulation is the process of wrapping up of data and methods into a single unit called class. It is a protective shield that 
    prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield. It is a mechanism that restricts direct access to some of 
    the objects components. Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing
    unauthorized partie's direct access to them. Encapsulation is used to restrict direct access to some of the object's components.
    Encapsulation is also known as data hiding. Encapsulation can be achieved by declaring all the variables in the class as private
    and writing public methods in the class to set and get the values of variables ussing diffrent access specifiers.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <strong>a. Constructor:</strong> Constructor is a special type of method that is used to initialize the object.
      <ul>
        <li>It is called when an object of the class is created.</li>
        <li>It is used to set the initial values of the object.</li>
        <li>//constructor name is same as class name.</li>
        <li>//constructor dont have return type.</li>
        <li>//constructor is called when object is created.</li>
        <li>//constructor can only be called once.</li>
        <li>//memory is allocated to object when constructor is called.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Types of Constructor:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Default Constructor:</strong> A constructor that has no parameters is known as a default constructor.</li>
        <li><strong>Parameterized Constructor:</strong> A constructor that has parameters is known as a parameterized constructor.</li>
        <li><strong>Copy Constructor:</strong> A constructor that initializes an object using another object of the same class is known as a copy constructor.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Constructor overloading:</strong> it is the condition when user define more than one constructor in a class with different parameters.</p>
      <p><strong>Constructor chaining:</strong> Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to the current object.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
      <strong>b. Destructor:</strong> Destructor is a special type of method that is called when an object is destroyed. It is used to release the 
      resources that are allocated to the object. Destructor is a special type of method that is called when an object
      is destroyed. It is used to release the resources that are allocated to the object. Destructor is a special type

    <h2>2. Abstraction</h2>
    <p>Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details from the user and only providing the necessary details.
    It is one of the most important concepts of OOPs. Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing 
    only the functionality to the user. Abstraction is used to only show the necessary features of the object.
    Abstraction is achieved by using abstract classes and interfaces. An abstract class is a class that 
    cannot be instantiated and is used to define the base class of other classes. An interface is a reference type in Java that is
    similar to class. It is a collection of abstract methods. A class can implement an interface.
    //data hiding</p>

    <div class="note">
      <strong>a. Abstract Class:</strong> An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is used to define the base class of other classes.
      <ul>
        <li>//cannot create instance of abstract class.</li>
        <li>//abstract class can have abstract and non abstract methods.</li>
        <li>//abstract class can have constructor.</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>b. Interface:</strong> An interface is a reference type in Java that is similar to class. It is a collection of abstract methods. A class 
      can implement an interface.
    </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>3. Inheritance</h2>
    <p>Inheritance is the mechanism in which one class acquires the properties and behavior of another class. It represents the 
    <strong>Parent-Child</strong> relationship. It is one of the most important concepts of OOPs. Inheritance is used to define the relationship
    between two classes. Inheritance is achieved by using the <code>extends</code> keyword. The class that is inherited is known as the parent class
    or superclass. The class that inherits the other class is known as the child class or subclass. Inheritance is used for code 
    reusability and method overriding.</p>

    <h3>a. Types of Inheritance:</h3>

    <h4>1. Single Inheritance:</h4>
    <p>Single inheritance is a type of inheritance in which a class inherits only single class. It is one of the most important concepts of OOPs.
    <pre>//class A extends B</pre></p>

    <h4>2. Multiple Inheritance:</h4>
    <p>Multiple inheritance is a feature in which a class can inherit from more than one superclass. However, Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes to avoid 
    ambiguity (the Diamond Problem). Instead, multiple inheritance in Java is achieved using interfaces.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Java Does Not Support Multiple Inheritance with Classes:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>*A class cannot inherit from multiple classes in Java using extends.</li>
          <li>*This prevents conflicts when multiple parent classes have the same method signature.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Java Supports Multiple Inheritance Using Interfaces:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>*A class can implement multiple interfaces using implements.</li>
          <li>*Since interfaces only contain abstract methods (before Java 8) or default methods (after Java 8), no ambiguity arises.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Diamond Problem Solution:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>*Since Java does not allow multiple class inheritance, it avoids the diamond problem, where a class could inherit the same method from two different parent classes.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>//class A extends B</pre>

    <h4>3. Hierarchical Inheritance:</h4>
    <p>Hierarchical inheritance is a type of inheritance in Java where multiple subclasses inherit from a single parent class. This means a single base class (superclass) acts as 
    a common ancestor for multiple derived classes (subclasses).
    Multiple Child Classes: In hierarchical inheritance, multiple child classes share a common base class but have their own individual features.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>*Code Reusability: The common properties and methods are inherited from the parent class, reducing code duplication.</li>
      <li>*Method Overriding: Subclasses can override the methods of the parent class to provide specific implementations.</li>
      <li>*Supports Polymorphism: Since multiple child classes inherit from the same parent, polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding.</li>
      <li>*Java Does Not Support Multiple Inheritance: While a class can have multiple child classes, a subclass cannot inherit from multiple classes directly due to Javaâ€™s restriction on 
      multiple inheritance (avoiding ambiguity).</li>
      <li>*Super Keyword Usage: The super keyword is used to call parent class methods or constructors in subclasses.</li>
    </ul>
    <pre>//class A extends B</pre>

    <h4>4. Hybrid Inheritance:</h4>
    <p>Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance, such as single, multilevel, hierarchical, and multiple inheritance. Java does not support hybrid 
    inheritance with classes due to the restriction on multiple inheritance (to avoid ambiguity). However, it can be achieved using interfaces.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>*Combination of Different Inheritance Types: It combines single, multilevel, hierarchical, and multiple inheritance.</li>
      <li>*Java Restriction on Multiple Class Inheritance: Java does not allow multiple inheritance with classes, preventing hybrid inheritance directly.</li>
      <li>*Achieved Using Interfaces: Hybrid inheritance can be implemented by using interfaces instead of classes.</li>
      <li>*Avoids Diamond Problem: Since Java allows multiple inheritance through interfaces, it prevents method ambiguity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>5. Multilevel Inheritance:</h4>
    <p>A subclass (Child) inherits from a superclass (Parent), and another subclass (GrandChild) inherits from Child.
    Forms a chain of inheritance.
    <pre>//class A extends B</pre></p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>4. Polymorphism</h2>
    <p>Poly means many and morphism means forms.
    Polymorphism is the ability of a variable, function or object to take multiple forms. It is one of the most important concepts 
    of OOPs. Polymorphism is used to define the many methods in a single class. It is achieved by using method overloading 
    and method overriding. Method overloading is a concept of having two or more methods with the same name in a class with different 
    parameters. Method overriding is a concept of having two methods with the same name and same parameters in two different classes.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <strong>a. Compile time Polymorphism:</strong> Compile time polymorphism is a type of polymorphism in which the method is called at compile time.
      It is also known as static binding or early binding. Compile time polymorphism is achieved by method overloading. Method 
      overloading is a concept of having two or more methods with the same name in a class with different parameters.
      <pre>//method overloading</pre>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
      <strong>b. Run time Polymorphism:</strong> Run time polymorphism is a type of polymorphism in which the method is called at run time. It is also 
      known as dynamic binding or late binding. Run time polymorphism is achieved by method overriding. Method overriding is a concept 
      of having two methods with the same name and same parameters in two different classes.
      <pre>//method overriding
//abstract class and interface.
//abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is used to define the base class of other classes.
//interface is a reference type in Java that is similar to class. It is a collection of abstract methods.
//A class can implement an interface.</pre>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Access Specifiers</h2>
    <p>//Private classes are not useful in java because they are not accessible from outside the class.</p>
    <p>//Protected classes are not useful in java because they are not accessible from outside the package.</p>
    <p>//Default classes are useful in java because they are accessible from outside the package.</p>
    <p>//Public classes are useful in java because they are accessible from anywhere.</p>
    <p>//child object can be given to reference of parent class but parent object cannot be given to reference of child class.</p>
    <p>// reference of parent class can not access the methods of child class.</p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Access Modifier</th><th>Default</th><th>Private</th><th>Protected</th><th>Public</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Same Class</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Same Package Subclass</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Same Package Non-Subclass</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Different Package Subclass</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Different Package Non-Subclass</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Static Keyword</h2>
    <p>The static keyword in Java is used for memory management mainly. It can be used with variables, methods, blocks, and nested classes. 
    The static keyword belongs to the class than an instance of the class.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <strong>a. Static Variables:</strong> Static variables are also known as class variables. They are shared among all the instances of the class. 
      Static variables are initialized only once, at the start of the execution. A single copy of the static variable 
      is created and shared among all the instances of the class. Static variables are created at the start of the 
      program execution and destroyed automatically when the program ends.
      <pre>//static int count=0;</pre>

      <strong>b. Static Methods:</strong> Static methods are also known as class methods. They can be called without creating an instance of the class. 
      Static methods can access static variables and static data directly. They cannot access non-static data members 
      or call non-static methods directly. Static methods are used to create utility functions that perform tasks not 
      dependent on instance creation.
      <pre>//static void display() { ... }</pre>

      <strong>c. Static Blocks:</strong> Static blocks are used for static initializations of a class. This code inside the static block is executed only 
      once: the first time the class is loaded into memory. A static block is also known as a static initialization block.
      <pre>//static { ... }</pre>

      <strong>d. Static Classes:</strong> A static class is a class that cannot be instantiated. It can contain only static members. Static classes are 
      used to create utility classes that contain static methods and variables.
      <pre>//static class MyClass { ... }</pre>
